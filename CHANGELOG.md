# Changelog

Versions are numbered `1.0`, `1.1`, `1.2`, … in order. Each release is one
merged change, and its commit subject carries the number (`v1.1: ...`), so
`git log --oneline` reads as the release history without needing tags.

## v1.5

Google Search Console flagged the live app (rekono-ai-new.onrender.com,
not the marketing site) as a "Deceptive pages" site -- Chrome would show
visitors a red warning. `Sample URLs: N/A`, so nothing to inspect directly;
had to reason out the actual cause from the code.

Ruled out first: no third-party/ad scripts, no `eval`, no redirects, no
phishing-style copy anywhere in the built site. The one meta tag that
looked suspicious on sight (`strix-verification`) turned out to be
legitimate and already explained by an earlier commit in this repo's own
history (#53) -- domain verification for a security-scanning tool, not
evidence of compromise.

The real cause: self-serve signup lets anyone set an organization's name to
literally anything (`org_name: z.string().min(1).max(256)`, no other
constraint), and that name rendered verbatim -- `You've been invited to
join ${org_name} on Rekono.` -- on the invite-accept page, which is
reachable with **no account**, by design, so an invitee can see the invite
before creating one. That's a free-text billboard on a legitimate domain,
sitting directly above a form asking for a name and password. Sign up once,
rename the org to something that reads like an urgent account-suspension
notice, generate one invite link, and the resulting URL is a phishing page
hosted on Rekono's own domain -- exactly what this flag describes, and
exactly the kind of thing that stops being reproducible (hence `Sample
URLs: N/A`) once the attacker's free trial or the invite token expires.

Fixed on two layers, since neither alone is sufficient:

- **Content**: `orgName.js`'s `orgNameSchema` rejects a name that's itself
  a URL (`http(s)://`, `www.`, or a bare `name.tld`), applied at both
  signup and org rename. Cheap, zero false-positive risk, closes the most
  mechanical version of the attack -- but a blocklist can't catch every
  phishing phrase, so it's not the real fix by itself.
- **Structure** (the actual fix): the invite-accept page no longer weaves
  the org name into a first-party-sounding sentence. It's quoted, under a
  fixed "Team invite" heading and a permanent disclaimer -- "Rekono doesn't
  verify organization names. If this doesn't look right, don't enter your
  password below." -- placed directly above the password field. This holds
  regardless of what the org name says, which a content filter alone never
  can.

Also: the whole app shell (`backend/public/index.html`) now sends
`noindex, nofollow`. It's an authenticated app shell that happens to also
serve the invite/reset panels, not marketing content -- there's no reason
for a crafted invite URL to be organically discoverable via search on top
of everything above.

Verified live, not just by reading the diff: signed up, created a real
invite, hit the actual invite-accept page with a real token, and confirmed
the org name renders quoted inside the new framing with the disclaimer
directly above the password field (screenshot taken via Playwright against
the running app). `tests/orgName.test.js` covers the schema directly plus
both real routes that accept an org name (signup, org rename) rejecting a
URL. Full suite: 634 passing, 0 failing (up from 624).

One earlier claim in this investigation turned out to be wrong and is
recorded here rather than quietly dropped: a missing `.nojekyll` file was
flagged as letting GitHub Pages serve the entire repo (source code
included) publicly. That's incorrect -- Jekyll's default processing only
excludes dotfiles/dotdirs, not regular directories like `backend/`, so
`.nojekyll` wouldn't have changed what's exposed either way. Not
implemented; whether the marketing-site repo being public already covers
this is a separate question for the user's own judgment call.

## v1.4

The marketing site read too small and too sparse -- both had a specific,
fixable cause rather than being a matter of taste.

**Too small:** `html`/`body` set `font-size: 15px`, 6% under the browser
default. Every rem-based size on the page -- headings, body text, buttons,
badges -- inherited that shrink uniformly. Back to 16px.

**Too sparse:** every major section (`HowItWorks`, `Features`, `Pricing`,
`FAQ`, `FinalCTA`) used `py-24` (96px top and bottom), so two adjacent
sections stacked to nearly 200px of pure whitespace between them -- visible
in a screenshot as a gap roughly as tall as the FAQ heading sitting above
it. Cut to `py-16` (`ProofStrip` to `py-10`, `Hero`'s asymmetric top/bottom
scaled down to match), which keeps each section legible as its own block
without the page reading like mostly blank space between five lines of
actual content.

Verified with real screenshots (Playwright against the production build, an
iPhone-width viewport matching the one in the report) at the hero and at
the pricing-to-FAQ boundary specifically, since that's where the gap was
most visible -- not just a visual guess that the numbers "should" look
better.

## v1.3

Adds `backend/scripts/check-llm.mjs`, a one-command preflight for whichever
LLM provider is configured. It calls `src/llm.js`'s `callTool` and
`generateText` directly -- the same code path extraction, categorization,
QuickBooks, and Ask Rekono all use -- so a pass here means those features
actually work, not just that a request shape looks right.

Exists because this sandbox can't verify that itself: `openrouter.ai` is
policy-blocked at the proxy level (`connect_rejected`, confirmed via the
proxy's own status endpoint), so v1.2 shipped with the wire format tested
against a stub and a local fake server, but no live call. This script is
what to run, with real credentials, wherever that block doesn't apply:

```
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=... OPENROUTER_MODEL=vendor/model-name node scripts/check-llm.mjs
```

Two checks: a forced tool call (adds two numbers via a `record_answer`
schema, so a pass also confirms the model gets simple arithmetic right
before it's trusted on invoice totals), then plain text. Failures are
specific rather than generic -- a model with no tool-calling support gets
told exactly that, since extraction, categorization, and both QuickBooks
suggestions all depend on it and silently fall back to the heuristic
extractor otherwise.

## v1.2

Any LLM call in the app -- extraction for all five document types, merchant
categorization, the two QuickBooks suggestions, and Ask Rekono -- can now run
on [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) instead of Gemini. `llm.js` is the
only file that knows which provider is active; everything else asks it for a
forced tool call or for text.

Set `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` **and** `OPENROUTER_MODEL` to use it. There is no
default model on purpose: slugs are specific and change as models come and
go, so a key with no model is treated as unconfigured and logs why, rather
than guessing one and failing at the first real extraction. The chosen model
must support tool/function calling -- extraction forces a JSON schema
through a named function, which is what produces a confidence per field. A
model without it fails every extraction into the heuristic path, and says
so. With both providers configured OpenRouter wins; `LLM_PROVIDER=gemini`
overrides. With neither, the heuristic fallback behaves exactly as before.

Worth recording: the first pass converted three call sites, which was wrong.
There were nine, across six files -- the four non-invoice document
extractors and both QuickBooks suggestions also built their own Gemini
client. Converting only the three would have left invoices on OpenRouter
while receipts, leases, vendor documents and tax documents silently dropped
to the heuristic extractor, which reads as the model getting worse rather
than as a half-finished migration.

## v1.1

Started numbering releases, with v1.0 as the baseline. Adds this changelog
and `CLAUDE.md`, which records the convention so it survives the container
being rebuilt between sessions.

Annotated git tags would be the conventional way to mark these, but the git
proxy in the Claude Code sandbox rejects `refs/tags/*` pushes, so the number
lives in the commit subject and here instead.

## v1.0

The first numbered version. Everything below already existed at the point
numbering started -- it's recorded here as the baseline the later entries
build on, not as work done for this release.

**Document pipeline.** Upload a PDF or image; Tesseract/Poppler lift the
text, a language model parses it into a fixed schema, and per-field
confidence plus a cross-check on the arithmetic decides whether it can be
auto-approved or needs a human. Falls back to a heuristic regex extractor
when no model key is configured, so the pipeline runs end to end without
one. Five document types on the same shape: invoices, expense receipts,
vendor documents, leases, and tax documents.

**Review and correction.** A reviewer sees the extracted fields beside the
source document, corrects what's wrong, and approves or rejects. Every
extraction, correction, approval and match decision writes an audit row. A
corrected vendor name is remembered and auto-applied next time the same raw
text comes in.

**Matching.** Fuzzy vendor matching with configurable amount tolerance and a
date window, plus exact PO/reference matching as a strong signal. Uploading
goods receipts switches it from two-way to three-way automatically, which
answers the question AP actually has before paying: was this ordered, did it
arrive, and does the bill agree with both.

**Multi-tenancy.** Every table that holds customer data carries an `orgId`,
every route scopes to the caller's org, and Postgres row-level security
enforces the same boundary underneath the application code, so a query that
forgets its scope returns nothing rather than another tenant's rows.

**Accounts and billing.** Email/password and Google sign-in, team invites
with per-plan seat caps, onboarding, Stripe-backed plans with a trial, and
per-plan monthly document caps.

**Integrations and export.** QuickBooks Online (OAuth connect, Bill push,
bank-transaction reconciliation) with tokens encrypted at rest; CSV and
Excel export with formula-injection neutralized.

**Hardening.** Rate limiting per account and per IP, re-authentication on
destructive actions, a fixed CORS allowlist, CSP and the standard security
headers, upload content-type derived from an extension allowlist rather than
the client's claim, and an error handler that never echoes internals.

**Surfaces.** The review UI (vanilla JS, no build step, served by Express)
and the marketing site (React + Vite + Tailwind, built into the repo root
for GitHub Pages).
